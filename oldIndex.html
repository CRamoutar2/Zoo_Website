    <h1> Welcome to the Ethereal Zoo </h1>
    <h2> Here we have numerous animals that were transferred here from other exhibits throughout the triborough as well as from outside the city</h2>
        <p> Our mission at the Ethereal Zoo is to give a better life to zoo animals that were in underfunded areas. Those areas lacked the 
            resources required to let these animals survive and thrive in their habitats. Whether these animals are rescued from dangerous locations throughout nature or
            brought to us from another zoo, we are making a point to take in any species, endangered or not, provided we can lead them to a better life.
