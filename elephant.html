    <h1><u>Elephant Exhibit</u></h1>
    <p>The pachyderms are provided with everything they need to survive and thrive,
         including first-class medical care, dedicated nutrition plans, training sessions, exercise and enrichment. 
        </br>
        The elephant team interacts with the animals through a protective barrier, a standard practice for zoos that are accredited 
         by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.</p>

    <p>The habitat itself is coated with fresh imported grass, new grass is planted every month accustomed with our delivery schedule. 
        </br>
        There are rubber coatings on the floor, which are especially useful for the elephants' baths. There are also a few areas that have broom-finished concrete or pavement. 
        The combination of hard and soft surfaces allows the Zoo’s elephants to choose areas most comfortable to them.

        <p align=right>From hilly corridors and time-released feeders to shade structures and pools, <br>our zoo creates a new benchmark for elephant health and well-being. We 
        will be able to largely expand <br>the level of care these animals receive and help accomplish what is not possible in the wild. At the Zoo, <br> the elephants receive daily, weekly, monthly and even annual enrichment to ensure that no two days are ever the same. Keepers may add novel objects — like musical instruments, tractor tires, bungee chords, scratch trees or boomer balls — to encourage the elephants to play with and 
        manipulate objects. Near the top of the hill, elephants are attracted to a 10-foot-tall tree to which keepers have added toys, browse and food-filled paper bags.</p>
