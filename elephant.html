      <p class="row-text">From hilly corridors and time-released feeders to shade structures and pools, our zoo creates a new benchmark for elephant health and well-being. We will be able to largely expand the level of care these animals receive and help accomplish what is not possible in the wild. At the Zoo, the elephants receive daily, weekly, monthly and even annual enrichment to ensure that no two days are ever the same. Keepers may add novel objects — like musical instruments, tractor tires, bungee chords, scratch trees or boomer balls — to encourage the elephants to play with and manipulate objects. Near the top of the hill, elephants are attracted to a 10-foot-tall tree to which keepers have added toys, browse and food-filled paper bags.</p>
