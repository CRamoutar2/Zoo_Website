    <br>
    <p>Llana is the daughter of our very own Larry and Letitia. Born in the Ethereal Zoo, Llana shares her white coat with her father, but has her mother's gentle disposition and love of showing off. She is set to be transferred to the San Diego Zoo at the end of the year, so she's been enjoying her time here before she gets to see the world and enjoy new sights and sensations.<p>
