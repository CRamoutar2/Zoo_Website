        <p>From the Leatherback Turtle to the Asian Giant Pond Turtle, our exhibit features a plethora of turtle species. These are just a few of the rare species that you can see relaxing and going about their daily life in our exhibit. These turtles receieve around the clock care due to our experienced Herpetologists, who have been working alongside these magnificiant creatures for many years. These turtles, alongside the rest of our animals here, have been rescued from underfunded and poor living conditions in both other zoos and in the wild.</p>
        <p>Wanting to give the turtles the feeling of being outside, we have made it so there is less furniture and human constructs in the exhibit. By having imported sand, seashells, and fresh water every month, the turtles won't feel as trapped as they would be around man-made constructs. With our imports, we ensure that not only will these turtles not be separated from their family, but also that they won't have to worry about excess garbage and waste existing in their habitat.</p>
